This lesson is about Redux-saga.

Redux-saga is a library which is used for applying asynchronous side effects to Redux's reducers.
It listens to a certain action and execute an asynchronous code via "saga watchers".
This makes the code very clean and organized due to the fact that it splits the synchronous reducers code and the asynchronous saga code.
