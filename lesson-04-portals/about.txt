This lesson is about solving an issue with elements which should be(for best practice reason) positioned in the DOM at a dedicated fitting spot.

For example: a modal.
A modal should not be placed inside of a <header> element,
It should be placed directly under the <body> element.

This is where React's portals come to help.
