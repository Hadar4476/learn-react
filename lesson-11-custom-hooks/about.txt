This lesson is about custom hooks in React,

The convention for creating a custom hook is the following:
1. Must be an exported function.
2. Must start with the word "use".

Custom hooks are like utilities but for much complex logic,
You can manage state there, use React basic hooks and receive
arguments which can effect the custom hook logic.
