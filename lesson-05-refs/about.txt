This lesson is about refs,
Refs are node elements references which can be accessed with	React hook - useRef.

Baisicly using ref is the equivalent of getiing node elements with: 

document.getElementById
document.querySelector

etc.

If I want to access something inside a referenced component from the outside of it, I can use useImperativeHandle hook.
