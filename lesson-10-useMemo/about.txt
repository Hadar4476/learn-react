This lesson is about useMemo hook,

This hook works similiar to useCallback hook but for arrays and objects.
It comes to solve the performance issue of components re-evaluation when the state updates.
Because Javascript can not compate non-primite types, such as functions, arrays and objects,
useMemo comes in act.
